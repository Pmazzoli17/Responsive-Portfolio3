			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<img src="assets/images/peter_profile.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Peter Mazzoli">

			<p>I was born on November 18, 1989 in Providence, Rhode Island. I moved to Michigan at the age of 5 and in Michigan is where I grew up and made many of my lifelong friends. In 2008 I attended WMU in Kalamazoo for College and I lived there until I graduated College in 2012.</p>

			<p>Upon graduation I got a job as an Account Manager at CH Robinson Inc. and I moved to Chicago, IL. I loved living in Chicago and it was a great experience, however I reached a plateau as far as how I could grow with the company. I decided it was time to move on and I recently moved to Raleigh, NC where I am starting a new adventure and learning web development at the UNC Bootcamp.</p>
